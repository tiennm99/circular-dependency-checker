# circular-dependency-checker
Detects cyclic dependencies in Godot Engine projects, which cause "bad address index" errors. This tool analyzes `.gd` script files to identify circular dependencies between classes.

*In 2025, I rewrote this project using Go. The Python version of this project can be found at [feature/python](https://github.com/tiennm99/circular-dependency-checker/tree/feature/python) branch.*

**Note: This Go version hasn't been tested yet. I don't work with GD projects anymore.**
